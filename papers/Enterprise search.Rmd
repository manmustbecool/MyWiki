#	SEARCH FUNDAMENTALS
Search might be a kind of new technology for many software applications. Production teams and management generally require a fundamental understanding of the technology before it can be introduced into production systems. Based our own experience and questions we encountered, we will try to answer the following questions, to give an introduction to search, rather than explaining the complex indexing mechanism or other technical details.

•	Why do we need search?
o	Search and SQL
•	How to give good search results?
o	Ranking and navigation
•	Can it scale out? 
o	Big data search
•	Is it production ready?
o	Search software
These questions will be answered in the following subsections

# SOLR SEARCH PLATFORM STACK

Search platforms are not majorly different from databases or data warehouse systems from a conceptual view. Search platforms are considered NoSQL data stores by many people. In databases, data is stored into structured tables, generally, and then queried from those tables. For search platforms, data is indexed as documents and then the documents are searched from the index. 

We classify and present the search platform in the following layers from bottom to top; from the various data sources in the data layer that would like to be searched to allowing the user to submit a search query and displaying results in end user UI applications.

 *  **Data** 
     + Purpose: Represent various data types and sources
 *  **Document building**
     + Purpose: Build document information for indexing 
 *  **Indexing and searching**
     + Purpose: Build and query a document index
 *  **Logic enhancement**
     + Purpose: Additional logic for processing search queries and results
 *  **Search platform service**
     + Purpose: Add additional functionalities of search engine core to provide a service platform.
 *  **UI application**
     + Purpose: End-user search interface or applications 

In the following, we are going to detail each layer and the corresponding software frameworks or components (Fig.1). Since Solr was selected for our study, as discussed in the previous section, only some major software related to Solr will be covered in here.

# Full detail in paper

The paper provides a brief report on search fundamental knowledge and study of Solr search platform stack. It answers common questions from management and development teams regarding adopting search technology for production development, and gives a Solr reference card for developers.  We also introduce two advanced search features, user experience based search recommendation and anomaly detection enhanced search ranking from our research work. Two features are developed to make network searches more efficient as it can help user quickly locate the most valuable search results, but the concept can be adopted for search applications in other domain
