# Basic

Install anaconda

# Data types

  * List
  
Lists are mutable
```python
l = [3, 4, 5]
l[0]

matrix = [ [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], ] # nested list
```

  * Tuples
  
Tuples are immutable sequences
```python
t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'
t[0]
```

  * Set
  
A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements
```python
basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}
```

# read head lines of a large text file

```python
file_name = "C:\\Users\\emiewag\\Desktop\\2014101709-12.txt"

with open(file_name) as myfile:
    head = [next(myfile) for x in range(20)]
print (head)

```

# real time plot with python

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.axis([0, 10, 0, 1])
plt.ion()

for i in range(100):
    y = np.random.random()
    plt.scatter(i, y)
    plt.pause(0.5)

while True:
    plt.pause(0.5)
```


# Install package

in cmd comand window
```python
# PyPI
