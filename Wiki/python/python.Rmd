# Basic

Install anaconda

# Data types

  * List
  
Lists are mutable
```python
l = [3, 4, 5]
l[0]

matrix = [ [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], ] # nested list
```

  * Tuples
  
Tuples are immutable sequences
```python
t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'
t[0]
```

  * Set
  
A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements
```python
basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}
```

# read head lines of a large text file

```python
file_name = "C:\\Users\\emiewag\\Desktop\\2014101709-12.txt"

with open(file_name) as myfile:
    head = [next(myfile) for x in range(20)]
print (head)

```

# Install package

```python
# in cmd comand window
pip install py2exe
conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/manmadescience py2exe
```
